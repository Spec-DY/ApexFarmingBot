# Apex Auto Farming Script

Apex Legends farming bot with freedom of selecting legends of your choices and specifying the number for each hero, updated for the latest Season 21.

## Notes
- Currently, only Chinese interface is supported.
- The program may stop unexpectedly, such as random pop up survey after a match, will be fixed in the future.
- You can move the mouse after the match starts and enters the map, but the script will start operating the interface after death. If interrupted, script must be restarted.


## Instructions

1. Change Apex to Chinese interface(English developing)
1. Start the game
2. Switch to 1920*1080 resolution, either fullscreen or windowed
3. Enter the main menu screen (the screen with the "Ready" button)
4. Download the files from the Release section
5. open "开刷" (if the .bat file fails, open files\dist\good\good.exe)
6. In the second popup window, enter: legend_name + space + number of drops, for example: baolei 2. You can also press Enter without entering anything, and it will use the currently selected hero. For legends name, you can refer to "英雄名称图".

- Please Refer to the screenshot named ""英雄名称图" in the same folder for the legend name abbreviations, without the .png extension.  
- You can type multiple hero and rounds of play combinations at once, separated by spaces, for example: waji 4 baolei 12 mingmai 1. The script will play as Wraith for 4 times, then Caustic for 12 times, and then Lifeline for 1 time.  
- After completing these tasks, the script will not stop until manually closed; it will continue farming with the last selected legend.
